== Introduction Enterprise Groovy Gradle Plugin

One of the biggest complaints about Groovy is that it's a dynamically compiled language, and that its
 optional static compilation feels bolted on. *The Enterprise Groovy Plugin* looks to fix this, by making static
 compilation the default, and gives you a configuration for optional enforcement. Groovy is a very
 powerful, and expressive language, and there may be times/places/companies, that want to take advantage of that power,
 but restrict it, because they have a large team, or have junior developers, etc. This is Where *Enterprise Groovy* comes
 in, giving you the tools to rein in some of the dynamic power, but whitelist it where it is needed.
