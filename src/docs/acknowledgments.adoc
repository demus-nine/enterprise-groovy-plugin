== Acknowledgments

With the Enterprise Groovy plugin, I'm "standing on the shoulders of giants", and would like to take the time to give a
special thanks, to the people, whose work made this plugin possible:

* Cédric Champeau(AKA melix) The original Author of @Compile Static.
* Paul King One of the biggest contributors to the Groovy Language, who also has worked on Groovy's static compilation.
* Hubert Klein Ikkink(AKA mrhaki) A major player in the Groovy Community, with this tutorial blog posts: `http://mrhaki.blogspot.com`
* Anyone who also worked on @CompileStatic, while I only saw Cédric, and Paul, I didn't do an exhaustive search of all the support classes.
* Anton Pryamostanov who tested out the earlier versions of Enterprise Groovy(RC1-RC4), which helped me figure out some gradle and configuration
issues.
