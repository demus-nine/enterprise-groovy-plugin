== Custom Compiler Script

The Enterprise Groovy plugin also supports a custom compiler script, which is how it configures adding the static compilation, and
the compilation checks. To customize the location of the compiler script you can set the following property in gradle.properties:
[source,groovy]
----
compilationScript = conventions.groovy
----

This is just a file path relative to the root of the project.

While a custom compiler script can provide functionality similar to this plugin, for compile static, it's not as flexible, and your
mileage may vary.
